# Finding My Passion
## How I got where I am Today
<small>Posted on March 4, 2021</small>

I'm working on an animated short. From here on out, I will be posting the process and a bit of the art while I create the Elusive Green Elephant (working title). My hope is that this blog will keep me accountable and that the short will be made with a special something. Before we get too far into that, I'm going to brief you on how I got here.

In 2019 I decided I needed a change. I had graduated from California College of the Arts (CCA) with a BFA in Animation in 2014. At the time, I knew it was difficult to break into the animation industry, and quite frankly, there wasn't any particular place I wanted to work. I always said I'd start my own studio. That plus the fact that California has a high cost of living, I decided to move back to my Chicago suburb and pay off my student loans.

In 2015, my sister Crystal (she's a great illustrator and comic artist) and I started the Sleepy Gallows to make shorts and mini series. Our first production is [For Peace, Love, and Harmony (PLH)](https://sleepygallows.com/Animation/originals/plh). A fun project, that became too much too handle and is currently on hiatus, but will return within the next 2 years.

In 2017 I paid off my loans in full, but was not working in the animation or art except a few freelance projects and PLH. By 2019, I needed a change. Still not wanting to live in California, and having no luck with Chicago's more commercial Motion Graphics industry, I looked to another interest of mine, web development and programming. 

So I jumped into a 6-month coding bootcamp at Northwestern University. The bootcamp ended in January of 2020 and the job hunt was on. I can now make basic apps in the MERN stack and build websites, but of course, there's still a lot to learn. March 2020 I was on the cusp of getting a Programming I position that I matched word of word on the job posting. It seemed perfect. The technical interview was scheduled and I was elated! Then the first lockdown happened. Not only was the interview cancelled, but the whole position had been pulled. I noticed across the board in many industries entry level positions were being pulled. So much for a change.

During those first few months of the new world I applied to places (tech and creative), got a few interviews, but no offers. But I was getting freelance animation, and these were people finding me. This is great because I like animating and need the money, but it is also bad timing. Now I don't have the time to study and keep up my coding practice.

What do I focus on?

For now, I'm choosing my passion. Join me on My Short Journey.

Catch ya next time!
